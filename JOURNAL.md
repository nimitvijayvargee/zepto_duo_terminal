# Day 3 - 27th June
Time Spent: 2hrs <br>
Designed the built-in keyboard, plan to use basic MX keys with an ortholinear layout. Also included sticky-keys indicators because holding keys simultaneously may be difficult to implement. Also laid out the keyboard both in Keyboard Layout Editor and KiCad. Decided to use a UART bus on 152Kbps
